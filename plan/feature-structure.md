# Planifest - Repository Structure

> The canonical layout for a Planifest-managed repository. Three top-level folders, three concerns.

---

## The Three Folders

```
repo/
+-- planifest-framework/        <- The framework (skills, templates, schemas, standards)
|                                  Drop this in. Don't modify it per-project.
|
+-- plan/                       <- The specifications (organized by feature)
|                                  Plans, briefs, specs, ADRs, risk, scope, glossary.
|                                  Everything that describes WHAT to build and WHY.
|
+-- src/                        <- The code (organized by component)
                                   Implementation, tests, config, manifests.
                                   Everything that IS the built thing.
```

## `planifest-framework/` - The Framework

This folder is the Planifest framework itself. It is the same across every project. You do not modify it per-feature - you update it when the framework evolves.

```
planifest/
+-- skills/           <- Agent instructions (orchestrator + phase skills)
+-- templates/        <- File format templates for every artifact
+-- schemas/          <- JSON Schema validation definitions
+-- standards/        <- Code quality standards
+-- spec/             <- This file - the canonical structure definition
```

---

## `plan/` - The Plan/Specifications

Organized by feature. Each feature gets a subfolder. This is where humans write briefs and agents write specs. No code lives here.

```
plan/
+-- {feature-id}/
    +-- feature-brief.md          <- Human input (start here)
    +-- design.md                 <- Validated plan (orchestrator output)
    +-- pipeline-run.md              <- Audit trail (per run)
    +-- pipeline-run-phase-2.md      <- Phase 2 audit (if phased)
    |
    +-- design-requirements.md               <- Functional & non-functional requirements
    +-- design-spec-phase-2.md       <- Phase 2 spec (if phased)
    +-- openapi-spec.yaml            <- API contract
    +-- scope.md                     <- In / Out / Deferred
    +-- risk-register.md             <- Risk items with likelihood & impact
    +-- domain-glossary.md           <- Ubiquitous language
    +-- security-report.md           <- Security review findings
    +-- quirks.md                    <- Quirks and workarounds
    +-- recommendations.md           <- Improvement suggestions
    |
    +-- adr/
        +-- ADR-001-{title}.md       <- Architecture decision records
        +-- ADR-002-{title}.md
        +-- ...
```

### Path Rules - plan/

1. **Feature ID** follows the format `{0000000}-{kebab-case-name}` - a 7-digit zero-padded number prefix for chronological ordering, followed by a human-chosen kebab-case name.
2. **No nesting** - specs, ADRs, and supporting docs are flat within the feature folder. One level of subfolders only (adr/).
3. **No code** - nothing executable lives in `plan/`. If it runs, it belongs in `src/`.
4. **Phased features** append the phase number: `design-spec-phase-2.md`, `pipeline-run-phase-2.md`. The `design.md` is updated per phase, not duplicated.
5. **ADRs** are numbered sequentially. Never renumber. Superseded ADRs stay with `status: superseded`.

---

## `src/` - The Code

Organized by component. Each component is a subfolder at the top level of `src/`. The component manifest lives with the code, not with the plan.

```
src/
+-- {component-id}/
    +-- component.yml               <- Component manifest (from template)
    +-- package.json                  <- (or equivalent for the stack)
    |
    +-- src/                          <- Implementation (structure varies by stack)
    |   +-- ...
    |
    +-- tests/                        <- Tests
    |   +-- ...
    |
    +-- docs/
        +-- data-contract.md          <- Schema ownership & invariants
        +-- migrations/
            +-- proposed-{desc}.md    <- Migration proposals
```

### Path Rules - src/

1. **Component ID** is kebab-case, matches the `id` in `component.yml`.
2. **component.yml is mandatory** - every component has one. Read it before any work; update it after every build.
3. **Component-specific docs** live with the component at `src/{component-id}/docs/`. These describe the component's data contract, migrations, and technical specifics.
4. **Feature-level docs** live in `plan/`. The component's `component.yml` references the feature via the `feature` field.
5. **Existing components** that predate Planifest are retrofitted by adding a `component.yml` at their root.

## How the Three Folders Connect

```
plan/current/design.md
    +-- lists component IDs -> src/{component-id}/component.yml
                                    +-- references feature -> plan/

plan/current/design-requirements.md
    +-- functional requirements -> implemented in -> src/{component-id}/src/

plan/current/adr/ADR-001-*.md
    +-- decisions -> followed by -> src/{component-id}/src/

plan/current/openapi-spec.yaml
    +-- API contract -> implemented in -> src/{component-id}/src/
```

The relationship is bidirectional:
- `design.md` lists all component IDs
- Each `component.yml` references its feature ID
- The plan describes WHAT; the code IS the WHAT

---

## Retrofit Ã¢â‚¬â€ Adding Planifest to an Existing Repo

If the repo already has code:

1. Drop `planifest/` into the repo root
2. Create `plan/` for the first feature
3. Move existing components under `src/` (or leave them if they're already there)
4. Add a `component.yml` to each existing component
5. The orchestrator's retrofit mode will read the codebase and infer the existing architecture

*Templates for each file are in [planifest/templates/](../templates/). Skills reference these paths.*
