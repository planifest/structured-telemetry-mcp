# Shorthand: GUTD

**When the human sends "GUTD", treat it as shorthand for "git up to date": check out `main`, pull the latest, and check for any untracked files.**

## Rule

On receiving the literal token `GUTD` (case-insensitive):

1. `git status` first — per standard safety practice, stash or flag anything uncommitted before switching branches.
2. `git checkout main`.
3. Pull the latest from `origin/main`. If local `main` has diverged (local-only commits not on `origin/main`), do not silently force-reconcile — investigate what those commits are first, same as any other unexpected local state, and prefer a reversible step (e.g. a backup branch) over discarding them.
4. Report any untracked files in the working tree (`git status --porcelain` `??` entries) — list them for the human rather than silently ignoring or cleaning them.

## Why

Established 2026-08-02 as a shorthand for a routine sync check the human runs often. Folds in the untracked-files check by default, since a prior "checkout main and pull latest" request surfaced local `main` commits that had diverged from `origin/main` (a stray, unfinished P0 pipeline run started directly on `main`) — worth surfacing untracked/stray state every time, not just when asked.
